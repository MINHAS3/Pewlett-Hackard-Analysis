The data that generated provides data into the age, length and seniority of employees in the company. 
Each of the tables provides their age, title and promotional into a senior position overtime. 
The limitations that I identified were that it was difficult to gather because of the amount of the employees and some transitioned into different roles years later, 
this made it difficult to sort that in the tables. I would have to rewrite the code to sort that information better. 
I would recommend to not include the history of titles for all employees, instead just include the length of time of employment with their current title, 
not to confuse the analyst. This won’t be time constraining, allowing the analyst to accurately make tables without errors. 


Good afternoon Bobby, I have identified the employees who are eligible for a mentorship program. 
In this table it displays the employees who will be part of the mentorship program. These employee’s birthday are arranged from Jan. 1, 1965 to Dec. 31, 1965.
